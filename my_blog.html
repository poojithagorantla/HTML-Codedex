I live my boyfriend and my fav human David. I like drawing sometimes. But i can only do it when i have a picture infront of me. I can't imagine anything new. Although I image 100 secnarios in my mind always.</article>

                <p>I love my cats Leafy and Autumn. Leafy is a black cat and Autumn is the crazy orange. Leafy is clam and very picky about what he eats. Autumn is crazy and will eat anything visible. Leafy is very strong. Although Autumn is a active cat, he is a weak baby.</p>
